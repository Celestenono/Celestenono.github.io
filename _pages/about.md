I am No√©mie a French post-doctorate in the field of IA for Medical Images.

I am currently working on the analysis of histopathological images in the [BozekLab](https://bozeklab.com/) at the [Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne](https://www.cmmc-uni-koeln.de/home).

I previously did my PhD on the analysis of PET/CT images of metastatic breast cancer patients at [Keosys](https://www.keosys.com/) and [LS2N](https://www.ls2n.fr/).

## Current Projects

### Since 2024: Survival Prediction Using Pancreatic Tissue Microscopy Images
*Image analysis, deep learning, histopathology, oncology*  
PANCALYZE project, conducted in collaboration with the University Hospital of Cologne.  
Development of deep learning algorithms for the prediction of patient survival using tissue microarray images.

### Since 2023: Automated Segmentation and Characterization of Renal Tissue Microscopy Images
*Image analysis, deep learning, histopathology, nephrology*  
FOrMe project, in collaboration with the University Hospital of Cologne.  
Development of deep learning algorithms for the analysis of renal tissue to characterize the nephrotic syndrome.
**Contributions:**
* New neural network architectures for glomeruli segmentation, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/bozeklab/GlomNet).
