## Since 2024: Survival Prediction Using Pancreatic Tissue Microscopy Images
*Image analysis, deep learning, histopathology, oncology*  
PANCALYZE project, conducted in collaboration with the University Hospital of Cologne as part of the postdoctoral fellowship at the Cologne Center for Molecular Medicine (CMMC).  
Developed deep learning algorithms to predict patient survival using tissue microarray images, enabling simultaneous analysis of numerous biopsy samples from multiple patients.

## Since 2023: Automated Segmentation and Characterization of Renal Tissue Microscopy Images
*Image analysis, deep learning, histopathology, nephrology*  
FOrMe project, in collaboration with the University Hospital of Cologne as part of the postdoctoral fellowship at the CMMC.  
**Contributions:**
* Designed new neural network architectures for glomeruli segmentation, available on GitHub.
* Presented findings at an international conference.

## 2020 - 2023: Automated Segmentation and Characterization of Lesions in PET/CT Images of Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients
*Image analysis, deep learning, radiology, oncology*  
Doctoral Thesis (CIFRE program) conducted with Keosys Medical Imaging, the West Cancer Institute, and the LS2N Laboratory as part of the EPICURE project.  
**Contributions:**
* Adapted the nnU-Net model for PET/CT lesion segmentation (originally designed for unimodal MRI, CT, and microscopy images).
* Developed a method for longitudinal segmentation of metastases across multiple whole-body PET/CT acquisitions.
* Proposed two new biomarkers for evaluating patient response to treatments.
* Delivered four presentations at international conferences and published one article in an international journal.

## 2019: Semi-Automatic Segmentation of Lesions in PET/CT Images of Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients
*Image analysis, deep learning, radiology, oncology*  
Final engineering internship at Keosys Medical Imaging, comparing semi-automatic segmentation algorithms from the literature with a deep learning-based method.  
**Contributions:**
* Integrated segmentation algorithms into Keosysâ€™s medical image visualization and annotation software.
* Presented findings at a national conference.
