# Research activities
## Research Projects:
### 2024: Survival Prediction Using Pancreatic Tissue Microscopy Images
*Image analysis, deep learning, histopathology, oncology*  
PANCALYZE project, conducted in collaboration with the University Hospital of Cologne as part of the postdoctoral fellowship at the Cologne Center for Molecular Medicine (CMMC).  
Developed deep learning algorithms to predict patient survival using tissue microarray images, enabling simultaneous analysis of numerous biopsy samples from multiple patients.

### 2023 - 2024: Automated Segmentation and Characterization of Renal Tissue Microscopy Images
*Image analysis, deep learning, histopathology, nephrology*  
FOrMe project, in collaboration with the University Hospital of Cologne as part of the postdoctoral fellowship at the CMMC.
**Contributions:**
* Designed new neural network architectures for glomeruli segmentation, available on GitHub.
* Presented findings at an international conference.

### 2020 - 2023: Automated Segmentation and Characterization of Lesions in PET/CT Images of Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients
*Image analysis, deep learning, radiology, oncology*  
Doctoral Thesis (CIFRE program) conducted with Keosys Medical Imaging, the West Cancer Institute, and the LS2N Laboratory as part of the EPICURE project.  
**Contributions:**
* Adapted the nnU-Net model for PET/CT lesion segmentation (originally designed for unimodal MRI, CT, and microscopy images).
* Developed a method for longitudinal segmentation of metastases across multiple whole-body PET/CT acquisitions.
* Proposed two new biomarkers for evaluating patient response to treatments.
* Delivered four presentations at international conferences and published one article in an international journal.

### 2019: Semi-Automatic Segmentation of Lesions in PET/CT Images of Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients
*Image analysis, deep learning, radiology, oncology*  
Final engineering internship at Keosys Medical Imaging, comparing semi-automatic segmentation algorithms from the literature with a deep learning-based method.  
**Contributions:**
* Integrated segmentation algorithms into Keosys’s medical image visualization and annotation software.
* Presented findings at a national conference.

## Supervisions:
* **February 2024 – June 2024:** Supervised Jacqueline Leal Castillo (Erasmus Mundus Master’s Program) on the topic: “Deep learning-based survival prediction for pancreatic cancer using histopathology images.”
* **Since October 2023:** Supervising Stanisław Janik’s Master’s thesis in Bioinformatics: “Detecting and classifying glomeruli structures in histopathological images.”

## Ph.D. Jury Participation:
* **July 2024:** Assessor for the Ph.D. defense of Hussein Naji, University of Cologne: “Deep Learning for Prediction of Recurrence of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma.”

# Funding proposal writing (2023–2024):
Involved in drafting, reviewing, and organizing meetings for funding proposals within Katarzyna Bozek’s research group.
* **Federal Ministry of Education and Research of Germany (BMBF):** Developing new approaches for data analysis and sharing in oncology research.
* **German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD):** International research collaboration project with Argentina.
* **German Research Foundation (DFG):** Research training group funding (RTG).

# Research outreach and science communication (2019–2022):
* Presentation of my research topic "Segmentation and characterization of breast cancer metastases" at the Natural History Museum of Nantes during the event "AI at the museum".
* Presentation of the research profession to high school students at Lycée Carcouet in Nantes with the association Cercle FSER (declics).
* Presentation of engineering studies and research at La Ville aux Roses middle school in Châteaubriant with the association FACE Loire-Atlantique (raising awareness about higher education among students from priority education middle schools).
* Presentation of the PhD and a serious game on artificial intelligence to a group of young girls from Stendhal middle school in Nantes with the association FACE Loire-Atlantique (Wi-Girls, raising awareness among priority education middle school girls about higher education in informatics).
